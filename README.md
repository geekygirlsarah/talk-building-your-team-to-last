# Building Your Team to Last

## Abstract

Hiring and onboarding new team members is an expensive and risky process. It's crucial to hire people who mesh well with the existing team and get them up to speed in a timely manner. Balancing this while minimizing the initial impact on productivity is often a challenge for even the most experienced lead developer.
This talk will cover some tips on building your successful team. We'll discuss:

- How to choose the right types of people to add to your team.
- How to onboard and mentor your new team members, including patterns of ineffective mentoring and why they're harmful to the team.
- How everyone can benefit from bringing on junior developers and interns the right way.

By the end, you'll see how your whole team will benefit from these strategies.
