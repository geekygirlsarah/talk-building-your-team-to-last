# Building Your Team to Last: Successful Onboarding and Mentoring Practices

##Abstract
Junior developers are often billed as _The Answer_ to the talent shortage in tech and the chronic homogeneity of the tech industry. Hiring a junior developer, however, is the _start_ and not the end of this process.

This talk will cover onboarding and mentoring junior developers successfully. We’ll discuss the benefits of bringing junior developers onto an established team. We’ll also show how senior AND junior developers can benefit by working together during the onboarding process. Some patterns of ineffective mentoring and why they are harmful to the team will be discussed. By the end, you’ll see how your whole team will ultimately benefit from these mentoring strategies.
